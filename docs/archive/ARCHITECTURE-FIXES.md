# Phoenix-vNext Architecture Fixes Applied

This document summarizes all architectural fixes applied to address fundamental flaws in the Phoenix-vNext adaptive cardinality optimization system.

## 1. Configuration Management Fixes

### Issue: Configuration file mismatch
- **Problem**: docker-compose.yaml referenced `main_updated_working.yaml` instead of `main.yaml`
- **Fix**: Updated to use the correct `main.yaml` configuration file
- **Impact**: Ensures consistent configuration between development and production

### Issue: Control file mounting
- **Problem**: Control file was mounted read-only but needed write access for updates
- **Fix**: Changed mount to read-write (`rw`) to allow file watching and updates
- **Impact**: Enables proper control loop functionality

## 2. Adaptive Routing Implementation

### Issue: All pipelines processing all metrics
- **Problem**: Routing connector sent metrics to all pipelines regardless of optimization profile
- **Fix**: Implemented `routing/adaptive_pipeline_selector` with conditional routing based on:
  - Current optimization profile from control file
  - Metric priority levels
  - Pipeline enablement rules
- **Impact**: Significant resource savings by only running necessary pipelines

### Routing Rules:
```yaml
- Full fidelity: Always receives all metrics (baseline)
- Optimised: Receives metrics when profile != "conservative"
- Experimental: Only receives metrics in "aggressive" mode
- Cardinality Observatory: Only high/critical priority metrics
```

## 3. Resource Management Improvements

### Issue: Shared memory limiter causing contention
- **Problem**: All pipelines shared a single memory_limiter instance
- **Fix**: Created separate memory limiters per pipeline:
  - `memory_limiter/common`: 800 MiB for intake
  - `memory_limiter/full`: 300 MiB
  - `memory_limiter/optimised`: 300 MiB
  - `memory_limiter/experimental`: 200 MiB
- **Impact**: Better resource isolation and predictable performance

### Issue: Oversized batch processing
- **Problem**: Batch size of 8192 caused latency spikes
- **Fix**: Reduced to 4096 with 5s timeout
- **Impact**: Lower latency and more consistent throughput

## 4. Metric Naming Consistency

### Issue: Cardinality counter metrics not properly recognized
- **Problem**: Transform processors created metrics with incorrect structure
- **Fix**: Updated transforms to properly set metric names and values in correct contexts
- **Impact**: Observer can now correctly track pipeline cardinality

### Issue: Observer metric name mapping
- **Problem**: Regex patterns didn't match actual metric names
- **Fix**: Updated observer scrape configs with precise metric name patterns
- **Impact**: Control loop receives accurate cardinality data

## 5. Control Loop Reliability

### Issue: Lock file not shared between containers
- **Problem**: Lock file in `/tmp` wasn't accessible across containers
- **Fix**: Added `phoenix_lock_volume` shared volume for lock coordination
- **Impact**: Prevents concurrent control script execution

### Issue: Missing template file
- **Problem**: Template file not mounted in control actuator container
- **Fix**: Added explicit mount for `optimization_mode_template.yaml`
- **Impact**: Control script can properly initialize control file

## 6. Security Enhancements

### Issue: Control actuator running as root
- **Problem**: Security risk from privileged container
- **Fix**: Enabled non-root user configuration with proper UID/GID
- **Impact**: Reduced attack surface

### Issue: Plaintext API keys
- **Problem**: Sensitive credentials in .env file
- **Fix**: Created `.env.secure.template` with best practices for secret management
- **Impact**: Guidance for production-ready secret handling

### Issue: No health checks for control actuator
- **Problem**: No visibility into control loop health
- **Fix**: Added health check using process monitoring
- **Impact**: Better observability and automatic recovery

## 7. Operational Improvements

### Issue: Observer over-provisioned
- **Problem**: Observer allocated 1 CPU for simple scraping
- **Fix**: Reduced to 0.5 CPU
- **Impact**: More efficient resource utilization

### Issue: No configuration validation
- **Problem**: Easy to deploy with misconfigurations
- **Fix**: Created `validate-config.sh` script
- **Impact**: Catches configuration errors before deployment

## Summary

These fixes transform Phoenix-vNext from a prototype with architectural flaws into a production-ready adaptive cardinality optimization system. The key improvements are:

1. **True adaptive behavior**: Pipelines now activate based on actual optimization profiles
2. **Resource efficiency**: Proper isolation and sizing prevent contention
3. **Reliable control loop**: Robust file locking and proper volume mounts
4. **Observable system**: Correct metric naming enables accurate monitoring
5. **Security hardening**: Non-root execution and secret management guidance
6. **Operational safety**: Health checks and configuration validation

The system now properly implements the intended adaptive cardinality management with threshold-based control and hysteresis, achieving the goal of dynamic optimization based on metric volume and system performance.
