# Phoenix-vNext Working System Summary

## Current Status

The Phoenix-vNext system is now operational with the following capabilities:

### ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **3-Pipeline Architecture**
   - **Full Fidelity Pipeline** (port 8888): ~3,954 metrics
   - **Optimised Pipeline** (port 8889): ~3,400 metrics (14% reduction)
   - **Experimental Pipeline** (port 8890): Configured but needs tuning

2. **Metric Collection**
   - Host process metrics collection working
   - Synthetic metrics generator producing ~750 processes across 3 hosts
   - OTLP ingestion endpoint functional

3. **Basic Filtering**
   - Optimised pipeline filters out low-value kernel processes
   - Priority classification based on process names
   - Attribute cleanup reducing cardinality

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations Due to Collector Version

1. **No Dynamic Configuration**
   - OpenTelemetry Collector v0.103.1 doesn't support `config_sources`
   - Cannot dynamically read control files
   - Pipeline selection must be done through environment variables and restarts

2. **No Adaptive Routing**
   - All pipelines run continuously
   - Cannot conditionally route based on optimization profile
   - Resource usage not optimized

3. **Complex Transform Syntax**
   - OTTL (OpenTelemetry Transformation Language) has strict requirements
   - Many advanced transformations not supported
   - Metric counting and aggregation limited

### üìä Current Metrics

```bash
# Check pipeline metrics
curl -s http://localhost:8888/metrics | grep -c "^phoenix_full_"  # ~3,954
curl -s http://localhost:8889/metrics | grep -c "^phoenix_opt_"   # ~3,400
curl -s http://localhost:8890/metrics | grep -c "^phoenix_exp_"   # 0 (needs tuning)

# Access Prometheus

```

### üîß Workaround for Adaptive Control

Since dynamic configuration isn't supported, adaptive control requires:

1. **Manual Profile Changes**
   ```bash
   # Update environment variable
   export OPTIMIZATION_PROFILE=balanced
   
   # Restart collector
   docker-compose restart otelcol-main
   ```

2. **External Control Loop**
   - Monitor metric counts via HTTP endpoints
   - Update docker-compose environment
   - Restart services when thresholds crossed

3. **Simplified Architecture**
   - Run all pipelines continuously
   - Use filtering within pipelines instead of routing
   - Accept higher resource usage

### üöÄ Next Steps for Production

1. **Upgrade Collector Version**
   - Move to version supporting config_sources (v0.104+)
   - Enable dynamic configuration
   - Implement true adaptive routing

2. **External Control Plane**
   - Build external service for dynamic control
   - Use Kubernetes ConfigMaps or similar
   - Implement gradual rollout of changes

3. **Alternative Approaches**
   - Use multiple collector instances
   - Implement control at metric source
   - Consider commercial solutions with built-in adaptive control

## Key Learnings

1. **Version Compatibility Critical**: Always verify feature support in specific versions
2. **Start Simple**: Complex configurations often hide fundamental issues
3. **Observable Behavior**: Use metrics endpoints to verify actual behavior
4. **Workarounds Possible**: Even with limitations, partial solutions can demonstrate value

## Commands for Testing

```bash
# Start system
docker-compose up -d

# Check health
docker-compose ps

# Monitor metrics
watch -n 5 'curl -s http://localhost:8888/metrics | grep -c "^phoenix_full_"'

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f otelcol-main

# Stop system
docker-compose down
```
